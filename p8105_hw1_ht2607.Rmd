# Question 1


```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

the variables in this dataset, are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. 
the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol) is nrow:358 and ncol:15
the mean temperature is 39.58212

```{r}
library (tidyverse)
plot_df = tibble(
  x = early_january_weather$time_hour,
  y = early_january_weather$temp
)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y), color= humid)+geom_point()
ggsave("plot_df.pdf")
```

the pattern of this scatterpoint is like zigzag line shape

# Question 2

```{r}
x = rnorm(10)
logical = x > 0
logical
character = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten")
character
```
